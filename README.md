#CS2110-Java-Object-Oriented-Programming-Programming-Assignment #SzymonSebMalecki #MiddlesexUniversity #CST2110

This repository presents my own sollutions to Java Programming Assignment From CST2110 (Object Oriented Programming) Module that I studied at Middlesex University in my second year. I included a pdf file with the specification and requirements of all three programming tasks inside this repository. First two tasks were Java Object Oriented challenges that required reading contents of the text file and implement all the functionality of the multi-selection serving a specified purpose. Third task was a JavaFx programming task that involved implementing  an exact copy of the basic JavaFx Gui for smart home controller application with some basic JavaFx functionality specified in the documentation with some specified functionality.
